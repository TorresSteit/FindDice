# FindDice
Dice Sum Calculator is a small Java program that helps users find all possible combinations of two six-sided dice that add up to a given target sum. This is a great example for learning loops and conditional statements in Java. The user inputs a desired sum, and the program outputs all the pairs of dice values that make up that sum.
